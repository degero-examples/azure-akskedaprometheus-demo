# AKS KEDA autoscaler demo

This is a demonstration of a multi app (2) deployment in Kubernetes with KEDA autoscaling on prometheus metrics.
It is also intentended to be used as a starter template to kickstart adapting a project and testing it locally for scaling needs.



> **⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️**  
> 
> This setup is designed for ease of use and demonstration purposes only. It is **not security hardened** and is **not suitable for production environments**.

Features include

- Ability to run locally (with Docker and KIND) to test your scaling needs without incuring hosting costs!
- Two nginx app deployments (app-one, app-two) with files served from a persistent volume
- Github token secret (for demonstration to follow to add your app secrets)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus) using annotation based scrape rules
- Option of private network load balancer or nginx ingress controller to access applications 
- KEDA scaler using Prometheus metrics for pod autoscaling
- Scale pods on http request count metric from nginx-ingress controller or pods in loadbalancer mode (using nginx prometheus exporter sidecar)
- Pod affinity/anti affinity options to ensure only one app per node (this is a demonstration, can be disabled)
- Secret creation for github token (for demonstration)


Azure features

- AKS node autoscaler with VirtualMachineScaleSets 5m idle scaledown
- Default workload nodepools scale to zero
- Azure files for workload persistant volume with Low cost tier 2GB default (to allow multiple scaled pods to access)
- AKS cluster, kubelet and KEDA user assigned identities for RBAC to resources (KEDA > Azure Monitor, Kublet > ACR, Cluster > VNET)
- VNet/NSG (port 80:443) configuration for private network load balancer access instead of public nginx-ingress
- Log analytics workspace for AKS log data collection
- Azure monitor workspace for Prometheus metrics (metric gathering defaults on)
- Azure Managed grafana for dashboards via Azure monitor (optional)
- Azure Container Regsitry (optional)
- AKS App routing addon (optional, there is a basic nginx ingress controller available by default. Requires a DNS A record to point to the ingress IP as it is not configurable to record metrics without a hostnae)

## Deployment

### Locally

Follow the workload deploy [README.md](./workload/README.md)

### Azure

#### Manual deployment scripts

IMPORTANT: Resources in Azure (primarily the nodepool VMs) cost money, use with caution and stop / delete AKS or the whole RG when not using.

To deploy to Azure AKS:

- Follow the infra deploy [README.md](./infra/README.md)
- Then the workload deploy [README.md](./workload/README.md)

## Azure Container Registry

One of the options is to enable Azure Container Registry (ACR) on installation. You can push an image to ACR and alter the workload/values-base.yaml for your desired image. Permissions are in place for AKS to pull from ACR however you will need to grant yourself 'AcrPush' Role on ACR to Push an image. To configure and connect to ACR see the [MSLearn ACR Authentication doco](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication?tabs=azure-cli#individual-login-with-azure-ad)

## Grafana

If you enabled grafana during installation the Azure Monitor Prometheus metrics endpoint is already connected. 
Here are some useful dashboards related to each of the configuration scenarios

### nginx ingress controller dashboards
